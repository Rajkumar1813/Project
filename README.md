# medicine-Project


This GitHub repository contains a medicine reminder web app created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes an external Bootstrap icons CDN for additional icons. Users can set their medicine or task time, and the alarm will sound 30 seconds before the set time, allowing them to complete their work at that moment. The app also features a timer and a clock displaying the current time. For more details and usage, visit the app's page.
